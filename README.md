## Description
The idea of this page is pretty simple, you want to relieve stress by breathing.
I put together this page so people can watch the videos I think is best for 
beginners to start practicing breathwork.
The home page is where you find the video section with a small description about it,
The About page is a more in-depth description of what breathwork is and its benefits of it.
Then you have the signup page if you want to become a member of the breathing family.

## Visuals

## Roadmap
In the future, I am going to make a zoom section where people can breath together, and put some more videos.
The magic happens when we do it together.
