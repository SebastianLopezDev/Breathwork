            <div class='child'><h1>Understanding Breathwork</h1>
                <p>Your breath brings oxygen into your body so that you can thrive. When you are physically or emotionally stressed, 
                    it affects how you breathe. Breathwork helps to calm your stress and bring balance to your body. So, how does it work, and what are breathwork techniques?
                    Breathwork is trendy right now, but it’s not new. People have been practicing breathwork for thousands of years, and it has roots in yoga practice.
                    The basic idea of breathwork is to release toxins and stress when you breathe out and nourish your mind and body when you breathe in.</p>
                    <p>Breathwork may also have a positive impact on your central nervous system. When you feel stressed, your breath tends to become fast and shallow. This limits the oxygen entering your bloodstream. Your brain tells your body that there is a threat, and your body responds in fight or flight.
                       When you take time to slow down and purposefully breathe deeply and slowly, you tell your brain that everything is OK.
                       Your brain communicates to your body that it’s safe to relax. The fight or flight response decreases, and your body can begin to function normally again.</p>
